Subject: Reimbursement Request for Knee Surgery

Hi Team,

I recently underwent a knee surgery on April 2nd, 2023, at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune. My Star Health policy (activated on January 1st, 2023) should now be past the 3-month waiting period.

Please confirm if I am eligible for reimbursement under the policy clauses.

Thanks,  
John Doe  
Policy No: SH123456
